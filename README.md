Wk 6 Homework assignment

This javascript application displays a couple of turquoise buttons on the top of the page. 
If you click on a specific button, ie puppies, the page will display 10 giphy images.
The images are displayed as still images.
Click on a still image, and it will animate into its giphy form.
Click again on the image, and it will return back to the still form. 

There is an input field in the upper right hand corner of the page, which allows you to add additional buttons. 

The theme of the page is animals.
